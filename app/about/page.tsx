          I graduated from Ege University, Department of Electrical and
          Electronics Engineering. Disciplined temperament, eager to learn new
          skills, prone to leadership capacity, became a leader at Kuleli
          Military High School. I am currently a software engineer passionate
          about learning new technologies. I have carried out projects using
          technologies such as Vue.js, React, Typescript, Pinia, Redux Toolkit,
          Canvas.js, Vue-query both alone and with a team. I worked closely with
          designers to ensure proper implementation of UI components and
          visuals. I adhered to Agile methodologies including Scrum and Kanban.
          I have improved myself in subjects such as leadership and teamwork. I
          have been working as a Frontend Developer since 2021. I have been
          working as a Frontend team leader for three months.
